"""Topological Neighborhood for Agent Interactions.

Implements scale-free neighbor-based interactions inspired by
starling murmuration research. Each agent interacts with N=7
topological neighbors (based on relationship strength, not distance).

Key insight from murmuration research:
- Each bird interacts with ~6-7 nearest neighbors regardless of density
- This creates scale-free correlations across the flock
- Information can propagate through the entire group
